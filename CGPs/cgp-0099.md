## Overview

In this governance proposal, we propose to execute the Celo Core Contracts Upgrade Release 10. This release follows the [release process](https://docs.celo.org/community/release-process/smart-contracts).

Changes that are being proposed in this release are described in [this Github release](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/releases/tag/core-contracts.v10). Hexens has completed an code audit of this release, and the tooling provided ensures the version control references included in the report match the contract deployment described in the proposal contents.

## Proposed Changes

Please see the [release notes](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/releases/tag/core-contracts.v10) for more details on the changes itself. The actual on-chain effects are as follows:

Core Contracts (via `setImplementation`)

- `Accounts`: `1.1.4.0` => `1.1.4.1`
- `BlockchainParameters`: `1.2.0.0` => `1.3.0.0`
- `FeeCurrencyWhitelist`: `1.1.0.0` => `1.1.1.0`
- `FeeHandler`: `N/A` => `1.1.0.0` 
- `GasPriceMinimum`: `1.1.1.0` => `1.2.0.0`
- `Governance`: `1.3.0.0` => `1.4.0.0`
- `LockedGold`: `1.1.2.1` => `1.1.3.0`
- `MentoFeeHandlerSeller`: `N/A` => `1.1.0.0` 
- `UniswapFeeHandler`: `N/A` => `1.1.0.0` 
- `Validators`: `1.2.0.4` => `1.2.0.5`

## Verification

TODO new steps to be completed

First make sure to download latest [celo-monorepo]([url](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/)) with

`git clone git@github.com:celo-org/celo-monorepo.git`

or to pull latest if downloaded previously:

`git pull`

then build it with:

`yarn && yarn build`

Once built, cd to the protocol folder with 

`cd packages/protocol`

From there you can download the current proposal:

```bash
../cli/bin/run governance:show --proposalID 135 --jsonTransactions release-10-proposal.json --node https://forno.celo.org
```

> **_NOTE:_** The CLI currently has a bug and this command will take a minute to run.

> **_NOTE:_**  Alternatively you can use the CLI distrubuted via npm, but make sure to have version 1.7.0 or higher (with `npm -g install @celo/celocli@1.7.0`). The command above will start with `celocli` instead of `../cli/bin/run` then.


And then verify that the proposal deployment matches audited release:

```
yarn verify-release -p release-10-proposal.json -b core-contracts.v10 -n mainnet -f -i "releaseData/initializationData/release10.json"
```

The output should verify that the bytecodes and storages match what is expected, it should look something like this:

```
Success, no bytecode mismatches found!
Writing linked library addresses to libraries.json
âœ¨  Done in 30.86s.
```

## Risks

Celo Core Contracts are critical for the functioning of the Celo Platform. While cLabs have invested significant efforts to expand testing and verification tooling, and a third party audit has been completed, errors in this proposal could lead to situations that are only recoverable with a very difficult hard fork.
