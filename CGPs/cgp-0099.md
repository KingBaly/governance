## Overview

In this governance proposal, we propose to execute the Celo Core Contracts Upgrade Release 10. This release follows the [release process](https://docs.celo.org/community/release-process/smart-contracts).

Changes that are being proposed in this release are described in [this Github release](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/releases/tag/core-contracts.v10). Hexens has completed an code audit of this release, and the tooling provided ensures the version control references included in the report match the contract deployment described in the proposal contents.

## Proposed Changes

Please see the [release notes](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/releases/tag/core-contracts.v10) for more details on the changes itself. The actual on-chain effects are as follows:

Core Contracts (via `setImplementation`)

- `Accounts`: `1.1.4.0` => `1.1.4.1`
- `BlockchainParameters`: `1.2.0.0` => `1.3.0.0`
- `FeeCurrencyWhitelist`: `1.1.0.0` => `1.1.1.0`
- `FeeHandler`: `N/A` => `1.1.0.0` 
- `GasPriceMinimum`: `1.1.1.0` => `1.2.0.0`
- `Governance`: `1.3.0.0` => `1.4.0.0`
- `LockedGold`: `1.1.2.1` => `1.1.3.0`
- `MentoFeeHandlerSeller`: `N/A` => `1.1.0.0` 
- `UniswapFeeHandler`: `N/A` => `1.1.0.0` 
- `Validators`: `1.2.0.4` => `1.2.0.5`

## Verification

First make sure to download latest [celo-monorepo]([url](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/)) with

`$ git clone git@github.com:celo-org/celo-monorepo.git --branch release/core-contracts/10 && cd celo-monorepo`

As this Contracts Release is the first one that uses nodejs 18, it is not recommend to start from a previously built clone. 

In case your system uses node 12, it can be upgraded with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). One installed the commands are:

`$ nvm install 18`
`$ nvm use 18`

Then build the repo:

`$ yarn && yarn build`

Once built, cd intoto the protocol folder with 

`$ cd packages/protocol`

From there you can download the current proposal:

```bash
$ ../cli/bin/run governance:show --proposalID 134 --jsonTransactions release-10-proposal.json --node https://forno.celo.org
```

> **_NOTE:_**  The celocli available on npm will not be able to download the proposal.


And then verify that the proposal deployment matches audited release:

```
$ yarn verify-release -p release-10-proposal.json -b core-contracts.v10 -n mainnet -f -i "releaseData/initializationData/release10.json"
```

The output should verify that the bytecodes and storages match what is expected.

It is recommended to use this same setup to verify (CGP-100)[./cpg-0100.md].

## Risks

Celo Core Contracts are critical for the functioning of the Celo Platform. While cLabs have invested significant efforts to expand testing and verification tooling, and a third party audit has been completed, errors in this proposal could lead to situations that are only recoverable with a very difficult hard fork.
