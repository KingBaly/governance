## Overview

This proposal is the last proposal of the UltraGreen ones. It aims to enable the buyback of non-Celo assets (currently only Celo assets) for Celo, using the MentoFeeHandler.

It also enables the distribution of fees to the Carbon Offseting Fund created in [CGP-0077](https://github.com/celo-org/governance/blob/main/CGPs/cgp-0077.md), as described in [CIP-52](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0052.md).



## Proposed Changes

All transactions have value=0.

1. Adding cUSD to the buyback
  - Destination: FeeHandler.addToken(tokenAddress, handlerAddress)
  - Data: cUSD address TODO, MentoFeeHandler address
2. Adding cEUR to the buyback
  - Destination: FeeHandler.addToken(tokenAddress, handlerAddress)
  - Data: cUSD address TODO, MentoFeeHandler address
3. Adding cREAL to the buyback
  - Destination: FeeHandler.addToken(tokenAddress, handlerAddress)
  - Data: cREAL address TODO, MentoFeeHandler address
4. Setting beneficiary as the Carbon Offseting Fund
   - Destination: FeeHandler.setFeeBeneficiary(beneficiaryAddress)
   - Data: Carbon Offseting Fund address 0xCe10d577295d34782815919843a3a4ef70Dc33ce
5. Set trade limit for cUSD
   - Destination: `FeeHandler.setDailySellLimit(address token, uint256 newLimit)`
   - Data: cUSD address, 1e21 (1000e18)
6. Set trade limit for cEUR
   - Destination: `FeeHandler.setDailySellLimit(address token, uint256 newLimit)`
   - Data: cEUR address, 1e21 (1000e18)
7. Set trade limit for cREAL
   - Destination: `FeeHandler.setDailySellLimit(address token, uint256 newLimit)`
   - Data: cREAL address, 1e21 (1000e18)

## Verification

TODO complete this

### Carbon fund address

`celocli network:parameters -n forno`

### Mento stables address

`celocli network:contracts -n forno`

### This proposals

`celocli governance:show --proposalID= -n forno`

## Risks

General contract risk: This is the first time the features in this proposal are deployed in production, although they were tested with the Canolli tesnet. 
Oracle Risk: in case the SortedOracles rate is manipulated, arbitragers (specially the ones using MEV) could be able to trade gainst the FeeHandler, but as the numbers are low the damage they can cause is very limited.
