**Proposal Overview:**

This proposal outlines a liquidity enhancement initiative aiming to deposit 10 million CELO into the stCELO protocol, followed by the deployment of the resulting stCELO into the Uniswap V3 pool. This action is designed to bolster the liquidity of CELO, thereby providing greater market stability and fostering an enhanced environment for CELO traders and investors.

**Summary:**

The initiative seeks to enhance the liquidity and overall health of the CELO ecosystem by:

Depositing 10 million CELO into the stCELO protocol. This step involves converting CELO into stCELO, a staked version of CELO that earns staking rewards and contributes to the security of the network.

Deploying the resulting stCELO into the Uniswap V3 liquidity pool. This action aims to improve liquidity on the decentralized exchange, facilitating smoother transactions and potentially reducing the impact of large trades on CELO's price.
